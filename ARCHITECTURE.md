    Explanation
       - Providers (plastic surgeons) can place Orders for different Products.
        Each order records which provider placed it, for which product, and in what quantity.
        An Inventory table tracks how many units of each product each provider currently has, and is updated each time a new order is placed and fulfilled.

I have organized the Laravel project to separate responsibilities and keep code scalable as the system grows.
All HTTP request/response logic (controllers and validation requests) are under Http/Controllers and Http/Requests, grouped by domain (here, under Provider/ for provider-only actions).
Business logic is kept out of the controllers and placed in Services, which improves testability and clarity.
Policies handle permission/checks, enforcing that only authorized users can create orders.
Events and Listeners manage asynchronous work (like sending emails).
Database migrations and seeders are organized separately for clean setup and demo data.
Feature tests for each vertical slice of business logic are kept in tests/Feature for easy access and maintenance.
